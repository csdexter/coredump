# The Concept of Freedom
<ol type="I">
<li>Measuring freedom.</li>
<ol>
<li>The concept of freedom is frequently discussed in human civilization. While some cases of freedom are clear cut (e.g. slavery in ancient Greece vs. a middle-class worker in present times), some others are marred in the difference between statute and perception (e.g. a corporate worker is legally free, but may lead a life which has attributes of a lack of freedom).</li>
<li>One particular incarnation of freedom which has interested philosophers and lawmakers alike is the, admittedly aspirational, <b>absolute</b> freedom.</li>
<li>Proponents of the concept argue that the individual is (or should) be absolutely free to govern their own life as they see fit, bar infringing on the "absolute" freedom of others of their kind.</li>
<li>Detractors, on the other hand, usually argue that freedom cannot be absolute because it is always curtailed by some superior authority, such as the government or the supranatural forces. </li>
<li>I believe that, in order to truly understand the measure of freedom and its practical limits, we have to look elsewhere, namely to the <b>context</b> in which freedom (absolute or less so) exists and is transacted.
