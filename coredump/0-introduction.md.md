# Introduction

## Dedication

To every good person I've ever met. To every professional I've had the privilege to witness at work. To A.P. for being a living example "astoundingly smart" doesn't have to come bundled with "weird". To S. for encouraging me to explore and reach higher.

## Motivation

I'm writing this text having gotten to the age when I have the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. It's more like a birthday present to myself, but many people whom I imparted my ideas on suggested I should put them in writing, so here goes.

## Structure

This is written similarly to a law, with titles and articles, in an attempt to (a) organize it and (b) make back-references easier to implement both on- and off-line. It is my belief laws cannot ever represent a situation exactly because (a) language is never that precise and (b) it would be unworkable to have a law written for every particular instance. As a result, I believe laws should always be accompanied by an interpretation -- whether that is authored side-by-side at the time the law was written and adopted or later on, after the law comes into effect, is irrelevant as long as the culture of having both the normative text and the "reading key" when judging endures.

## Bona fide

This is the best version I could come up with at the time of publishing. I don't purport to be an expert in everything and I'm also subject to error. If you see something objectively wrong, that doesn't make sense or that you think can provide a better version of, do please send in a contribution (see `CONTRIBUTIONS` in the root folder).

## Rules of engagement

This is meant as an academic discourse and I will hold any communication related to this text to the same standard. Any interaction which is clearly headed out of the vernacular straight into the vulgar will be ignored and removed on sight without notice and without explanation (this paragraph is your explanation). The same treatment will be applied to any instances of *ad hominem*. Repeat offenders will be referred to the relevant authorities.

Please remember you're reading this text off the Internet, not as part of a news bulletin on your national TV station. If you don't like what you're reading, simply close the browser window -- it's easier and cheaper.

Finally, there are multiple copies of this document and it is always (re)published (when updated) in multiple places. Further digital and hard copies are periodically forwarded to various news outlets with precise instructions to publish in its entirety should anything happen to one of the regular publishing places.
