# Introduction

## Motivation

I'm writing this text having gotten to the age when I have the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. It's more like a birthday present to myself, but many people whom I imparted my ideas 

## Structure


This is written similarly to a law, with titles and articles, in an attempt to (a) organize it and (b) make back-references easier to implement both on- and off-line.
