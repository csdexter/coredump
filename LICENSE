1) You may read the documentation any number of times, regardless of rendering
   (i.e. the source code, a PDF rendering, a print on A4 paper, the sound
   output of your text-to-speech system reading the documentation etc.). This
   includes permission to access the documentation for the purpose of reading.
   For the avoidance of doubt, "reading" is meant for personal use of an
   individual, specifically when such an individual has full unrestricted
   access to the entirety of the documentation and can freely choose to read
   any part of it.
   "reading" to an audience does not qualify under this heading as the audience
   cannot freely, e.g., skip to the last page as an individual described
   previously could.
2) You may distribute (either by copying or by forwarding to the original
   source) the documentation any number of times, provided you do not alter it
   in any way. Exceptions are:
   2a) Excerpts are fine as long as (a) the author is properly credited, (b)
       the location in the documentation whencefrom the excerpt was taken is
       clearly given and (c) a clear mention is made along with the excerpt
       that those desiring the full context should peruse the complete
       documentation, available at the original source.
   2b) Translations are fine as long as they are (a) done by a certified
       translator (for the language pair involved) and (b) faithful to the
       original source version in meaning. The restriction of being faithful to
       the original source version in meaning applies to translated excerpts as
       well.
   2c) Reversible and temporary alterations are fine as long as they are always
       reverted when the documentation is accessed for reading (e.g.
       compressing via bzip2 for storage is fine, since the decompressed output
       exactly matches the original input).
   2d) Irreversible alterations imposed by the reading medium are fine,
       provided they do not infringe on the faithful to the source in meaning
       restriction (e.g. black and white output of originally color
       documentation -- including alterations of, e.g., diagrams to use an
       alternate representation of color in the original, e.g., via hatch
       patterns).
3) You may not create derivative commercial works from the documentation
   (including the degenerate case of a work with no deviation, i.e. selling the
   documentation verbatim). Exceptions are:
   3a) You may charge the fair market price for distributing unaltered copies
       of the documentation. Said price must be similar to one charged for any
       other documentation of similar size, complexity and rendering method and
       must not in any case exceed your actual expenses incurred with the
       distribution.
   3b) You may charge the fair market price for translating an unaltered copy
       of the documentation. Said price (a) must be similar to one charged for
       translating a documentation of similar size and complexity and (b) must
       be for the translation labor alone (i.e. you may not charge royalties
       for distribution of the translated version).
   3c) You may create visual art (e.g. a poster) from an excerpt of the
       documentation and derive profit from selling said art, provided that
       (a) the author is credited and the location in the documentation
       whencefrom the excerpt was taken is clearly communicated to each buyer
       of said art (not necessarily integral to the artwork itself but
       necessarily at the moment of sale) and (b) your commercial enterprise
       does not materially depend on the documentation for its commercial
       success (i.e. you cannot sell only posters with quotes from the
       documentation).
4) You may not use the identity of the documentation (i.e. the author's name
   and/or the documentation's text or excerpts therefrom) to promote your
   products and services (this does allow you to publicly admit your
   product/service was inspired by the documentation or somehow else follows
   the spirit of it).
